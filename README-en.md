# Queue Systems 
Hospitals, companies, and businesses use customer queue systems to increase efficiency and improve customer experience. Queue systems help organize and manage customer arrivals, reduce waiting time, increase organization and operational efficiency. A queue system is an automated or semi-automated system used to manage and coordinate the flow of people or services within an organization, such as a hospital, company, or business. This system helps optimize customer or patient waiting time, enhancing efficiency and organization in the service delivery process. 
# How it works
We need 2 screens to use (Can share 1 computer, put in Extend mode for 2 screens)<br />
1 screen will be at index.php<br  />
![demo](https://i.upanh.org/2024/04/16/Screenshot_20240416-212155_Chromebee1b414b2611a09.jpeg)
- When customers enter information, that information will be saved in data.json
- <br />
- - The remaining screen will be in the show-queue.php file to display the queue -<br />

  #### There are also utilities for admin (employees) - File admin.php will display the queue list and utilities such as calling order numbers and deleting names in the queue<br />
